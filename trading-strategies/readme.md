# Strategies:
- **Using RSI with Bollinger Bands:**
  - Add both RSI and Bollinger Bands to a chart.
  - When the RSI is above 70 and the price touches the upper Bollinger Band, it might indicate overbought conditions and a potential reversal.
  - Conversely, when the RSI is below 30 and the price touches the lower Bollinger Band, it might indicate oversold conditions and a potential buying opportunity.

## 1. **Moving Averages and MACD**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add a 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) and a 200-period SMA.
     - Add the MACD indicator.
   - **How to Use:**
     - **Golden Cross:** When the 50-SMA crosses above the 200-SMA, it’s a bullish signal (potential buy).
     - **Death Cross:** When the 50-SMA crosses below the 200-SMA, it’s a bearish signal (potential sell).
     - Use MACD to confirm the trend direction. For instance, if there’s a Golden Cross and the MACD line is above the signal line, it strengthens the buy signal.

## 2. **RSI and Bollinger Bands**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add the RSI indicator with default settings (14-period).
     - Add Bollinger Bands with default settings (20-period SMA and 2 standard deviations).
   - **How to Use:**
     - **Overbought Condition:** If RSI is above 70 and the price is near or above the upper Bollinger Band, it may indicate an overbought condition (potential sell).
     - **Oversold Condition:** If RSI is below 30 and the price is near or below the lower Bollinger Band, it may indicate an oversold condition (potential buy).

## 3. **Stochastic Oscillator and Support/Resistance Levels**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add the Stochastic Oscillator with default settings.
     - Identify key support and resistance levels on the chart.
   - **How to Use:**
     - When the Stochastic Oscillator is above 80 (overbought) and the price is near a resistance level, it may signal a potential sell.
     - When the Stochastic Oscillator is below 20 (oversold) and the price is near a support level, it may signal a potential buy.

## 4. **ATR and Breakouts**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add the ATR (Average True Range) indicator with default settings.
   - **How to Use:**
     - Use ATR to gauge the volatility. High ATR values indicate high volatility, while low ATR values indicate low volatility.
     - For breakout trades, wait for the price to move significantly above or below a support/resistance level with a rising ATR. This suggests a strong move backed by increased volatility.

## 5. **OBV and Price Divergence**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add the On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator.
   - **How to Use:**
     - Look for divergences between the OBV and price. If the price is making new highs but the OBV is not, it may indicate a potential reversal or weakening trend (potential sell).
     - Conversely, if the price is making new lows but the OBV is not, it may indicate a potential reversal or strengthening trend (potential buy).

## 6. **Pivot Points and Fibonacci Retracement**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add Pivot Points (set to daily for day trading or weekly for swing trading).
     - Add Fibonacci Retracement levels from a significant high to a significant low.
   - **How to Use:**
     - Use Pivot Points as potential support and resistance levels. If the price breaks above a pivot point, it may indicate a continuation of the trend (potential buy). If it breaks below, it may indicate a reversal (potential sell).
     - Use Fibonacci Retracement levels to find potential support and resistance. For example, a 61.8% retracement level often acts as a strong support or resistance. Look for price action signals (like candlestick patterns) at these levels to confirm the trade.

## 7. **Combination of Indicators for a Comprehensive Strategy**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add a 20-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average).
     - Add RSI.
     - Add Bollinger Bands.
   - **How to Use:**
     - **Buy Signal:**
       - The price crosses above the 20-EMA.
       - RSI is above 50 but below 70.
       - The price is near the lower Bollinger Band or just bounced off it.
     - **Sell Signal:**
       - The price crosses below the 20-EMA.
       - RSI is below 50 but above 30.
       - The price is near the upper Bollinger Band or just bounced off it.

## Practical Example Summary:
- **Using Moving Averages and MACD:** Look for Golden Cross/Death Cross for trend direction and use MACD for confirmation.
- **Using RSI and Bollinger Bands:** Identify overbought/oversold conditions.
- **Using Stochastic Oscillator and Support/Resistance:** Combine overbought/oversold conditions with key price levels.
- **Using ATR for Breakouts:** Monitor ATR for volatility to confirm breakouts.
- **Using OBV for Divergence:** Spot divergences between OBV and price for potential reversals.
- **Using Pivot Points and Fibonacci Retracement:** Identify key support/resistance levels and confirm with price action.

By combining these indicators and setups, traders can develop robust strategies tailored to different market conditions.
