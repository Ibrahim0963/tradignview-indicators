# Different types of indicators
TradingView is a popular charting and trading platform that offers a wide array of tools for technical analysis, including indicators. Indicators on TradingView help traders analyze price movements, identify trends, and make informed trading decisions. Here’s an overview of the types of indicators available on TradingView and their purposes:

## 1. **Trend Indicators**
   - **Moving Averages (MA):** A line that shows the average price over a certain number of days. Common types include Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA). It helps to see the overall direction of the market. If the line is going up, the market is generally going up, and if it's going down, the market is generally going down.
   - **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** shows the difference between two moving averages. It helps to identify changes in the market trend. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it might be a good time to buy. When it crosses below, it might be a good time to sell.
   - **Average Directional Index (ADX):** This measures the strength of a trend but not the direction. It helps traders determine whether the market is trending or ranging.

## 2. **Momentum Indicators**
   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** A number between 0 and 100 that shows if something is overbought (too high) or oversold (too low). If RSI is above 70, it might be overbought (too high and might go down). If RSI is below 30, it might be oversold (too low and might go up).
   - **Stochastic Oscillator:** compares the current price to the price range over a recent period. If the value is above 80, the market might be overbought (too high). If it's below 20, the market might be oversold (too low).
   - **Rate of Change (ROC):** This measures the percentage change between the current price and the price a certain number of periods ago.

## 3. **Volatility Indicators**
   - **Bollinger Bands:** Two lines that form a band around the price line based on volatility. If the price touches the upper band, it might be too high and could come down. If it touches the lower band, it might be too low and could go up.
   - **Average True Range (ATR):**  measure of how much the price moves on average during a given time period.It helps to understand market volatility. High ATR means the market is more volatile, while low ATR means the market is less volatile.

## 4. **Volume Indicators**
   - **On-Balance Volume (OBV):** This uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price. It’s calculated by adding volume on up days and subtracting it on down days. If OBV is going up, it might mean more people are buying. If OBV is going down, it might mean more people are selling.
   - **Volume Moving Average (VMA):** This is the average volume over a specified period, helping to smooth out volume data.

## 5. **Support and Resistance Indicators**
   - **Pivot Points:** Key price levels calculated from the previous day's prices.These levels can act as support (price stops going down) or resistance (price stops going up).
   - **Fibonacci Retracement:** Lines that indicate where the price might find support or resistance based on Fibonacci ratios. Use these lines to predict where the price might reverse direction.

## 6. **Custom Indicators**
   - **Pine Script:** TradingView allows users to create custom indicators using Pine Script, a lightweight scripting language. This enables traders to tailor indicators to their specific needs and strategies.

# Strategies:
- **Using RSI with Bollinger Bands:**
  - Add both RSI and Bollinger Bands to a chart.
  - When the RSI is above 70 and the price touches the upper Bollinger Band, it might indicate overbought conditions and a potential reversal.
  - Conversely, when the RSI is below 30 and the price touches the lower Bollinger Band, it might indicate oversold conditions and a potential buying opportunity.

## 1. **Moving Averages and MACD**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add a 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) and a 200-period SMA.
     - Add the MACD indicator.
   - **How to Use:**
     - **Golden Cross:** When the 50-SMA crosses above the 200-SMA, it’s a bullish signal (potential buy).
     - **Death Cross:** When the 50-SMA crosses below the 200-SMA, it’s a bearish signal (potential sell).
     - Use MACD to confirm the trend direction. For instance, if there’s a Golden Cross and the MACD line is above the signal line, it strengthens the buy signal.

## 2. **RSI and Bollinger Bands**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add the RSI indicator with default settings (14-period).
     - Add Bollinger Bands with default settings (20-period SMA and 2 standard deviations).
   - **How to Use:**
     - **Overbought Condition:** If RSI is above 70 and the price is near or above the upper Bollinger Band, it may indicate an overbought condition (potential sell).
     - **Oversold Condition:** If RSI is below 30 and the price is near or below the lower Bollinger Band, it may indicate an oversold condition (potential buy).

## 3. **Stochastic Oscillator and Support/Resistance Levels**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add the Stochastic Oscillator with default settings.
     - Identify key support and resistance levels on the chart.
   - **How to Use:**
     - When the Stochastic Oscillator is above 80 (overbought) and the price is near a resistance level, it may signal a potential sell.
     - When the Stochastic Oscillator is below 20 (oversold) and the price is near a support level, it may signal a potential buy.

## 4. **ATR and Breakouts**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add the ATR (Average True Range) indicator with default settings.
   - **How to Use:**
     - Use ATR to gauge the volatility. High ATR values indicate high volatility, while low ATR values indicate low volatility.
     - For breakout trades, wait for the price to move significantly above or below a support/resistance level with a rising ATR. This suggests a strong move backed by increased volatility.

## 5. **OBV and Price Divergence**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add the On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator.
   - **How to Use:**
     - Look for divergences between the OBV and price. If the price is making new highs but the OBV is not, it may indicate a potential reversal or weakening trend (potential sell).
     - Conversely, if the price is making new lows but the OBV is not, it may indicate a potential reversal or strengthening trend (potential buy).

## 6. **Pivot Points and Fibonacci Retracement**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add Pivot Points (set to daily for day trading or weekly for swing trading).
     - Add Fibonacci Retracement levels from a significant high to a significant low.
   - **How to Use:**
     - Use Pivot Points as potential support and resistance levels. If the price breaks above a pivot point, it may indicate a continuation of the trend (potential buy). If it breaks below, it may indicate a reversal (potential sell).
     - Use Fibonacci Retracement levels to find potential support and resistance. For example, a 61.8% retracement level often acts as a strong support or resistance. Look for price action signals (like candlestick patterns) at these levels to confirm the trade.

## 7. **Combination of Indicators for a Comprehensive Strategy**
   - **Setup:**
     - Add a 20-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average).
     - Add RSI.
     - Add Bollinger Bands.
   - **How to Use:**
     - **Buy Signal:**
       - The price crosses above the 20-EMA.
       - RSI is above 50 but below 70.
       - The price is near the lower Bollinger Band or just bounced off it.
     - **Sell Signal:**
       - The price crosses below the 20-EMA.
       - RSI is below 50 but above 30.
       - The price is near the upper Bollinger Band or just bounced off it.

## Practical Example Summary:
- **Using Moving Averages and MACD:** Look for Golden Cross/Death Cross for trend direction and use MACD for confirmation.
- **Using RSI and Bollinger Bands:** Identify overbought/oversold conditions.
- **Using Stochastic Oscillator and Support/Resistance:** Combine overbought/oversold conditions with key price levels.
- **Using ATR for Breakouts:** Monitor ATR for volatility to confirm breakouts.
- **Using OBV for Divergence:** Spot divergences between OBV and price for potential reversals.
- **Using Pivot Points and Fibonacci Retracement:** Identify key support/resistance levels and confirm with price action.

By combining these indicators and setups, traders can develop robust strategies tailored to different market conditions.
