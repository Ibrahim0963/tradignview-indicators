# Different types of indicators
TradingView is a popular charting and trading platform that offers a wide array of tools for technical analysis, including indicators. Indicators on TradingView help traders analyze price movements, identify trends, and make informed trading decisions. Here’s an overview of the types of indicators available on TradingView and their purposes:

## 1. **Trend Indicators**
   - **Moving Averages (MA):** A line that shows the average price over a certain number of days. Common types include Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA). It helps to see the overall direction of the market. If the line is going up, the market is generally going up, and if it's going down, the market is generally going down.
   - **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** shows the difference between two moving averages. It helps to identify changes in the market trend. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it might be a good time to buy. When it crosses below, it might be a good time to sell.
   - **Average Directional Index (ADX):** This measures the strength of a trend but not the direction. It helps traders determine whether the market is trending or ranging.

## 2. **Momentum Indicators**
   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** A number between 0 and 100 that shows if something is overbought (too high) or oversold (too low). If RSI is above 70, it might be overbought (too high and might go down). If RSI is below 30, it might be oversold (too low and might go up).
   - **Stochastic Oscillator:** compares the current price to the price range over a recent period. If the value is above 80, the market might be overbought (too high). If it's below 20, the market might be oversold (too low).
   - **Rate of Change (ROC):** This measures the percentage change between the current price and the price a certain number of periods ago.

## 3. **Volatility Indicators**
   - **Bollinger Bands:** Two lines that form a band around the price line based on volatility. If the price touches the upper band, it might be too high and could come down. If it touches the lower band, it might be too low and could go up.
   - **Average True Range (ATR):**  measure of how much the price moves on average during a given time period.It helps to understand market volatility. High ATR means the market is more volatile, while low ATR means the market is less volatile.

## 4. **Volume Indicators**
   - **On-Balance Volume (OBV):** This uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price. It’s calculated by adding volume on up days and subtracting it on down days. If OBV is going up, it might mean more people are buying. If OBV is going down, it might mean more people are selling.
   - **Volume Moving Average (VMA):** This is the average volume over a specified period, helping to smooth out volume data.

## 5. **Support and Resistance Indicators**
   - **Pivot Points:** Key price levels calculated from the previous day's prices.These levels can act as support (price stops going down) or resistance (price stops going up).
   - **Fibonacci Retracement:** Lines that indicate where the price might find support or resistance based on Fibonacci ratios. Use these lines to predict where the price might reverse direction.

## 6. **Custom Indicators**
   - **Pine Script:** TradingView allows users to create custom indicators using Pine Script, a lightweight scripting language. This enables traders to tailor indicators to their specific needs and strategies.
