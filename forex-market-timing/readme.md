# Trading sessions vs. Overlapping sessions
**Trading sessions** and **overlapping sessions** in the Forex market refer to different periods of trading activity and their impacts on market liquidity and volatility. Here’s a clear distinction between the two:

  - **Summer (CEST):** 12:00 AM to 9:00 AM
- **Characteristics:**

#### **1.2. Tokyo Session (Asian Session)**
- **Germany Time (CET/CEST):** 
  - **Winter (CET):** 1:00 AM to 10:00 AM
